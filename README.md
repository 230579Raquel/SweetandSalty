#Candy shop
A candy store asks us for a website of its business. It's the first time they're going to have a space on the web. The main idea is to publicize their catalog and provide information about the company and how to contact them.

##Getting started
Project documentation is available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/230579Raquel/SweetandSalty.git

COMENTARIO: ES NECESARIO PONER COMO CLONAR EL REPOSITORIO ETC? SE SUPONE GITHUB ES DE USO HABITUAL

##Functionalities
We have designed a 16x16 px favicon to identify the web on the Internet, for example, in the browser tab. We have used xxxxxx and xxxxx.
The product catalog has been divided into categories using HTML containers and CSS.
When passing over the image of the product the user can see the description of it, for this we have included Javascript.

##Build with
HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT.
